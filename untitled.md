#Notes MSc (BEEM101) comments

#Specific topics, focus, approach

- Highlight *relevance* of theory
    - Why are, e.g., demand curves, important
    - Suggestion: Giffen and Veblen goods and the firm's optimisation
- Apart from the theoretical explanation, try to bring in real data
    - (e.g., oil market example)

- psychology and/of economics
    - relation to utility, happiness
    - prospect theory, regret/disjunction effect

- Game theory
- international trade

- economics to assess market power, price elasticity etc.,
- behavior of monopolists and consumers in different markets

- One application: taxation and firms
- how to use this stuff empirically

- Realistic and practical examples from the corporate world

- Developing research skills

##Articles of interest

- None were mentioned in particular, but students expressed an interest in
    - applied articles relevant to business and policy
    - a focus on highlighting key results, insights, and methods *within* these articles

#Module structure

##Textbook
##Problem sets
##Enrichment material (e.g., Autor notes)

- Students found this interesting but did not want to be examined on it.
- Most (?) would prefer enrichment in terms of applied work rather than mathematical rigour (unless it adds insight)

##Mathematical level
- most students think it is about right (?)

#Student's interest, Career goals
- Students are interested in working in both the public and private sector. (I forgot to ask about entrepreneurship or sectors of the economy.)
    - I hope to learn more specifics.
- Few students have a 'job waiting for them.'
    - At least one works in regulation of utilities/antitrust

#Points of confusion
- Some students were confused by the Cobb-Douglas example, and the solved problem.
    - $\rightarrow$  This is covered in later problem sets, and I will go through an example in a later tutorial
