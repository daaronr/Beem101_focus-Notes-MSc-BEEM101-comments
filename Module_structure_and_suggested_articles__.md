##Textbook
##Problem sets
##Enrichment material (e.g., autor notes)

- Students found this interesting but did not want to be examined on it.
- Most (?) would prefer enrichment in terms of applied work rather than mathematical rigour (unless it adds insight)

##Mathematical level
- most students think it is about right (?)

#Student's interest, Career goals
- Students are interested in working in both the public and private sector. (I forgot to ask about entrepreneurship or sectors of the economy.)
    - I hope to learn more specifics.
- Few students have a 'job waiting for them.'
    - At least one works in regulation of utilities/antitrust

#Points of confusion
- Some students were confused by the Cobb-Douglas example, and the solved problem.
    - --> This is covered in later problem sets, and I will go through an example in a later tutorial
